== Description ==

The easiest way to post jobs and manage applicants in a WordPress site.

Job Manager is the cool and easy plugin to display relevant jobs on any page. Job Manager connects with your SmartRecruiters Recruiting Software to automate job posting and candidate management.

Jobs posted from your SmartRecruiters Software will automatically be displayed in your WordPress site.

Applicants can easily apply online, upload a resume, or use their LinkedIn or Facebook profiles. All applicants are consolidated within a single web interface in order to easily manage them through the entire hiring process.

Job Manager leverages your existing style sheet and lets you filter jobs listed by location and department. This allows you to display the relevant jobs on the right web pages, while maintaining your brand.

Job Manager is easy to [install](http://dev.smartrecruiters.com/?page_id=23) and only requires a SmartRecruiters account. SmartRecruiters is the Open Recruiting Software that is entirely free. Sign up [here](http://www.smartrecruiters.com/static/wordpress_signup).
